**IDE used:**
- VSCode for react-native javascript
- Android studio for android development and Android Virtual Device (AVD)

**Notes for android:**
- Command `react-native run-android` on Mac OS may run you into issue. Please refer this link to resolve that
- Send Ctrl + M to Android Virtual Device:
'adb shell input keyevent 82'
- refer https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52919945/how-to-pass-extra-auth-parameters-for-firestore-rules-authentication-react-nati to set rules for CRUD actions in firestore
- Google-services.json and debug.keystore are the 2 important files. We need those files for Google service authentication to interact with firebase services. Please contact ntdquang1412@gmail.com or tbecnel14@gmail.com for these files as well as permission to the project on Google Cloud Platform
- Those 2 files should be under ./android/app/
- Without those files, you will not be able to build the Android project.

**Note for iOS**
- GoogleService-Info.plist. We need this file for Google service authentication to interact with firebase services. Please contact ntdquang1412@gmail.com or tbecnel14@gmail.com for these files as well as permission to the project on Google Cloud Platform
- This file should be placed under ./ios/
- Without this file, you will not be able to build the iOS project.
